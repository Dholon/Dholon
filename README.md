👋 Hi, I’m @Dholon Kumar Paul!

👀 I’m interested in:
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) and materials science research.
- Optoelectronic properties of perovskites and high band-gap semiconductor materials.
- Advanced computational techniques in quantum physics and condensed matter physics.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Hybrid DFT methods for defect engineering in materials.
- SCAPS for solar cell device modeling with DFT driven data.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Research projects related to perovskite materials, solar cells, and electronic structure calculations.
- Papers focused on defect-induced property modifications in semiconductors.
